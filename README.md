# ripple-model

![output](./ripples.png)

A simple coupled map lattice (CML) model for the formation dynamics of ripples by wind-blown sand, based
on the model by Nishimori and Ouchi (1992). 

The model incorporates the elementary sub-aerial sand transport processes of
grain saltation (i.e., near-bed 'downwind' transport) and surface creep 
(included here as a localized diffusive process).
